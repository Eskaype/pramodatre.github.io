I am a PhD candidate at the Kno.e.sis Center, Wright State University, Dayton, OH. 
I work in the area of Semantic Web under the guidance of Prof. Amit P. Sheth, who is 
the founder and executive director of Kno.e.sis Center. I'm co-advised by 
Prof. T. K. Prasad with whom I work on devising algorithms to deal with heterogeneity, 
uncertainty, incompleteness, and dynamism in domains such as sustainability (e.g., Smart Cities) 
and Healthcare. I'm passionate about data science for social good which resonates in my research projects.
